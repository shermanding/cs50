## Credit

This program will check a user input credit card number and determine if it is valid.
The program uses Luhn's algorithm as a checksum to determine the validity of a credit card number without having to look up a database.

It checks if the input number is a VISA, MASTER or AMEX credit card and returns an INVALID if the number is not valid.
