## Caesar's Cipher

This program will allow users to send confidential messages by encrypting using a cipher. The cipher would allow encryption of messages by rotating each letter by *k* positions, 
and the recipients would have to decrpyt by shifting the letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.

The user input, or plaintext will be encrypted using a user-defined key which is a positive integer.

#### Example 
If the program uses a key of 13 and a plaintext of "hello, world".

***./caesar 13***

***plaintext:  hello, world***

***ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq***
