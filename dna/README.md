## DNA

DNA is a program that allows profiling of a DNA sequence against a DNA database to find out the owner of the DNA sequence.
It uses the Short Tandem Repeats of DNA bases which tend to repeat consecutively in specific locations of a person's DNA. THe program looks at multiple STR such that it will be able to correctly identify a specific person with almost no error.
