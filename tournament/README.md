### Tournament

Tournament is s program that allows simulations of a Football tournament. The tournament consists of multiple layers of run simulations where each team plays another team and losing teams are eliminated. Each team are given ratings which are numerical values that represent the relative skill level.
We use the team ratings to simulate the tournament, by simulated rounds until we are left with one final team. The tournament winner is then simulated multiple times to count how many times a team wins a simulated tournament and estimate which team wins.
