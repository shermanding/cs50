## Filter

Filter is a program that parses images through different filters; simulating what photo applications do to digital photos when filters are applied.
A picture is a sequence of bits, arranged in a particular manner to represent captured information.

The filters play on the RGB values of each pixel, and adjusting them provides the effects of particular filters.

Some of the filters included are:

***1) Grayscale***

***2) Sepia***

***3) Reflection***

***4) Blur***
